# Flower

A CLI tool made to help developers using Git Flow and Conventional Commits.

## How to Install

Currently, the CLI is only on `brew`:

````bash
brew install KaueSabinoSRV17/homebrew-flower/flower
``````

## How to Use

Currently, it has only the `commit` command:

````bash
flow commit
``````

It will ask you what files you are going to add to git, what is going to be the Conventional Commit prefix
and the Commit Message. After that, you can run `git log` to validate the commit
